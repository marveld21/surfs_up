## Summary
### It seems that the temperature in the area doesn’t vary much between the 2 months we looked at. Id like to see another set of queries for spring and fall(March & September) to be sure there isn’t any strange weather during those seasons. Also we didn’t review precipitation data which is included in our dataset and would give additional insight.
